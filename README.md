# TitanicDataset
### Import Libraries and read data
1) Import all the libraries as per requirement of the task.
2) Read the given dataset in whichever format it is provided, be it csv, xlsx, json or any other format.

### DATA PREPROCESSING
1) First we must get insights on relevant or irrelevant features and then they must be taken care of.
2) Taking care of string data, such as "Sex" column which contains values as "male" or "female", to be able to process data. It must be changed to Integer values, for example: 1 for male, 0 for female. This could be done using dummy values.

### FEATURE ENGINEERING
1) Finding dependent and Independent features.
2) Split the dataset into test and train data.

### FIT MODEL
1) Now, we are all set to fit the dataset to train our model.

### PREDICTIONS
1) For predictions, use testing dataset and generate predictions and other performance evaluation metrics based on these predictions.
